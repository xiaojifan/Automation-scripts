# Autotyper Script

## Short description

This Python script reads lines from a text file and types them automatically, simulating human-like typing behavior using the `pyautogui` and `time` libraries.

## Short description of script

The script achieves automated typing of text from a file to any active window. It waits for a few seconds to allow the user to focus the cursor on the desired input area before typing begins.

## Setup instructions

1. Install required libraries:
   ```pip install pyautogui

   ```
2. Place your text file (e.g., text.txt) in the same directory as the script or provide an absolute path in the code.
3. Run the script:
   ```python autotyper.py

   ```
4. Switch to the window where you want the text to be typed. The script will begin typing after a 5-second delay.
